# 📲 Install Zappy AI in 12 Fool‑Proof Steps

1. **Sign in to GitHub** (or make a free account).
2. Click **New repository** → name it `zappy_ai_flutter`.
3. **Download** `zappy_ai_flutter.zip` from ChatGPT (the file you’re reading this in).
4. Unzip it. Drag‑and‑drop everything into the new repo’s *Add files → Upload* page. Commit.
5. GitHub may ask to **enable Actions**. Click **I understand & enable**.
6. Click the **Actions** tab. You’ll see **Build Zappy AI APK** running.
7. Wait ~5 min. When the run turns 🎉 **green**, click it, then **Artifacts → zappy_ai_apk → Download**.
8. On your phone, open that `app-release.apk` (or move it there via USB/Drive/AirDrop).
9. Android will say “Install unknown apps.” Tap **Settings → Allow** for your browser or file manager, then back.
10. Tap **Install**. You now have **Zappy AI** in your app drawer!
11. First launch: go to **Settings → API Keys** and paste your own OpenRouter / HuggingFace keys (demo keys may rate‑limit).
12. Ask anything, generate images, or just chat. Zappy remembers what you teach it.

That’s it — zero coding, zero Android Studio.
